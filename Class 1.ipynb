    "* Like every other major industry, CRE will be disrupted by the application of technology empowered by data analytics. \n",
    "* It will be called different things, but it is the same thing.\n",
    "    * Econometrics and forecasting\n",
    "    * Statistical learning\n",
    "    * Machine learning\n",
    "    * Artificial intelligence (**not really**)\n",
    "* Why?\n",
    "    * Example: I want to predict what the 10-Year U.S. Treasury is going to be in the future to determine a realistic DCF for my property.\n",
    "    * Example: I want to predict what the cap rate on this property is, based on its characteristics.\n",
    "    * Example: I want to predict how likely my current tenant is to churn at the end of her lease term.  (And whether I can intervene to affect the decision.)\n",
    "    * Example: I want to predict how labor costs will change with time.\n",
    "    * Example: Given the current interest rate environment, demand for hard assets like CRE is strong.  Algorithmic deployment of capital.  \n",

    "    * Time series as storytelling and for forecasting.\n",
    "    * Examples of when algorithms fail and considerations about causation.\n",
    "* Introduce you to R and R Studio to rapidly expand your tool kit.\n",
    "    * Provide historical background in probability and statistics.\n",
    "    * R is a low-level programming language developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (hence R). \n",

    "    * Occasional use of Python graphics in class.\n",
    "    * Visualizations and Monte Carlo methods rather than mathematical proofs.\n",

    "                * Stable code base and platform\n",
    "                * Open source and free\n",

    "* Typical week: Lecture with multiple examples, together with graded weekly assignments.  \n",
    "    * I know of no other way to learn data analytics than to do it repeatedly.\n",
    "    * **Data analytics is a contact sport**.\n",
    "* By the end of this class, you will know more about data analysis than the chief economists of either CBRE or JLL. \n",
